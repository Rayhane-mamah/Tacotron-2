	#Audio
	#Audio parameters are the most important parameters to tune when using this work on your personal data. Below are the beginner steps to adapt
	#this work to your personal data:
	#	1- Determine my data sample rate: First you need to determine your audio sample_rate (how many samples are in a second of audio). This can be done using sox: "sox --i <filename>"
	#		(For this small tuto, I will consider 24kHz (24000 Hz), and defaults are 22050Hz, so there are plenty of examples to refer to)
	#	2- set sample_rate parameter to your data correct sample rate
	#	3- Fix win_size and and hop_size accordingly: (Supposing you will follow our advice: 50ms window_size, and 12.5ms frame_shift(hop_size))
	#		a- win_size = 0.05 * sample_rate. In the tuto example, 0.05 * 24000 = 1200
	#		b- hop_size = 0.25 * win_size. Also equal to 0.0125 * sample_rate. In the tuto example, 0.25 * 1200 = 0.0125 * 24000 = 300 (Can set frame_shift_ms=12.5 instead)
	#	4- Fix n_fft, num_freq and upsample_scales parameters accordingly.
	#		a- n_fft can be either equal to win_size or the first power of 2 that comes after win_size. I usually recommend using the latter
	#			to be more consistent with signal processing friends. No big difference to be seen however. For the tuto example: n_fft = 2048 = 2**11
	#		b- num_freq = (n_fft / 2) + 1. For the tuto example: num_freq = 2048 / 2 + 1 = 1024 + 1 = 1025.
	#		c- For WaveNet, upsample_scales products must be equal to hop_size. For the tuto example: upsample_scales=[15, 20] where 15 * 20 = 300
	#			it is also possible to use upsample_scales=[3, 4, 5, 5] instead. One must only keep in mind that upsample_kernel_size[0] = 2*upsample_scales[0]
	#			so the training segments should be long enough (2.8~3x upsample_scales[0] * hop_size or longer) so that the first kernel size can see the middle 
	#			of the samples efficiently. The length of WaveNet training segments is under the parameter "max_time_steps".
	#	5- Finally comes the silence trimming. This very much data dependent, so I suggest trying preprocessing (or part of it, ctrl-C to stop), then use the
	#		.ipynb provided in the repo to listen to some inverted mel/linear spectrograms. That will first give you some idea about your above parameters, and
	#		it will also give you an idea about trimming. If silences persist, try reducing trim_top_db slowly. If samples are trimmed mid words, try increasing it.
